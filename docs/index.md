# Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (Amstelodamensis)

This is the
[text-fabric]({{tfd}})
version of the Hebrew Bible Database,
containing the text of the Hebrew Bible augmented with linguistic annotations compiled by the
[Eep Talstra Centre for Bible and Computer]({{institute}}), VU University Amsterdam.

The text is based on the
[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia]({{dbgAcademic}})
edited by Karl Elliger and Wilhelm Rudolph,
Fifth Revised Edition, edited by Adrian Schenker,
Â© 1977 and 1997 Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart.

The [text-fabric]({{tfd}}) version has been prepared
by Dirk Roorda [Data Archiving and Networked Services]({{dans}}),
with thanks to
Martijn Naaijer,
Cody Kingham,
and Constantijn Sikkel.

There are more formats in which the data is available.
In the `shebanq` subdirectory you find data in MQL format and in MYSQL format that directly goes into
the SHEBANQ website.

In the
[`bigTables`]({{repoBase}}/programs/bigTables.ipynb)
you find ways to export the complete data as one big table, and store it in R format or in Pandas format.
The notebooks 
[`bigTablesP`]({{repoBase}}/programs/bigTablesP.ipynb)
and
[`bigTablesR`]({{repoBase}}/programs/bigTablesR.ipynb)
show you a few things that you can do in R and Pandas.

## Provenance
The source data resides on a server of the ETCBC, managed by Constantijn Sikkel.
He makes that data available as an [MQL]({{mql}}) database dump,
together with supplementary data files.
From there it is transported to this GitHub repo by means of a [pipeline]({{org}}/pipeline).

This dataset contains several versions of the BHSA, from 2011 till now.
When you navigate to a version, you'll see more information about that version and its provenance.

For all versions the
[pipeline]({{org}}/pipeline)
has been followed.
For the newer versions, starting with `2016`, additional data is available in other repositories.
**See the footer of this page**.

In text-fabric it is easy to load the features of several datasets in one session.

## References
We have compiled a list of [references](references.md) to give an impression by what principles
and methods the ETCBC has carried out its text analyses.

## Workflow
The pipeline above is complicated and not free of
[cruft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruft).
It would be better if the ETCBC could deliver its core data directly in text-fabric format,
with inclusion of the lexical features, the ketiv-qere data and the paragraph numbers.
But at least all the fine distinctions that need to be made between versions have been diagnosed and dealt with
in this pipeline.

## Reproducible science
We intend to follow a practice that allows for data updates on the one hand, and reproduction of old
results on the other.

In SHEBANQ, there are several versions of the data and they are all frozen.
Data version `c` is peculiar, because it was intended as a moving version, alongside the
frozen version. But we have abandoned the idea, and it has become a frozen version,
sitting oddly between `2017` and `2021`.
We preserve it, because SHEBANQ has saved queries against this version.

Frozen versions in SHEBANQ will remain there forever,
and publishing queries and annotations against frozen
versions will remain supported.

In particular, versions `3`, `4` and `4b` are here to stay.
Version `3` because it is relatively old, and represents an earlier stage in the
feature organization of this database.
Versions `4` and `4b` because queries have been published that are based on them.

These versions are also firmly entrenched in the academic record, by virtue of being archived.
