**root**

##### Note
> 
This feature is present on objects of type [*word* and *lex*](otype.md).

>
This feature is experimental and incomplete
(about 14% of the lexemes have this feature assigned).
Hence, it is not present on all words.

>
Constantijn Sikkel has remarked
"that the feature is not single-valued in principle; a lexeme can have zero, one, or more roots",
but as far as I can see, there is never more than one root on a lexeme.
