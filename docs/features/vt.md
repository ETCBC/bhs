Form of the verb that indicates tense or mood.

[`word`](otype.md).

The Hebrew verb has multiple stems, and each of these stems can be marked with tense/mood.
For the possible stems, see [`vs`](vs.md).
Not all words have verbal tense (e.g. nouns) and these are marked as `NA`.

`infc` |infinitive (construct)
`ptca` |participle
`ptcp` |participle (passive)
