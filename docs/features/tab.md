**tabulation**


The level of this `clause_atom` in the enclosing hierarchy.

This feature is present on objects of type
[`clause_atom`](otype.md).

##### Note
> The original definition says:
"The number of tab stops in the hierarchical display of the tree of clause atoms."
How can this feature be understood without reference to a display?
It seems to be the nesting depth of the clause atom, but in what tree?

Maybe we need a separate page about the `clause_atoms` and the structures
they are a member of.
