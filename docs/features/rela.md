**relation**


The linguistic relation between the object and its context.

This feature is present on objects of type
[`clause`, `phrase(_atom)`, and `subphrase`](otype.md).

# Subphrase


code|code|description
---|---|---
`ADJ`|`adj`|Adjunct
`ATR`|`atr`|Attribute
`DEM`|`dem`|Demonstrative
`MOD`|`mod`|Modifier
`PAR`|`par`|Parallel
`REG`|`rec`|Regens

The kind of relationship between the object (daughter) and its mother.
In case of the regens/rectum relation, the mother is not a `subphrase`, but a word.
The upper case values apply to the mother `subphrase` and the lower case values
apply to the daughter `subphrase`.
See [`mother`](mother.md).

##### Note
> In MQL the feature applies to the *daughter* only; the mother has the value `NA`.

##### Note
> Consider leaving out the uppercase values, since they do not occur in MQL.

# Phrase atom


code|description
---|---

# Phrase


code|description
---|---
`PrAd`|Predicative adjunct
`Resu`|Resumption

This feature expresses how phrases refer to each other.
The value for `rela` has been derived from the value of phrase [`function`](function.md) of the daughter
(`PrAd` yields `PrAd`)
or the mother (`Frnt` yields `Resu`).
See [`mother`](mother.md).
The mother of a resumption can be a clause, namely when the constituent in question resumes a casus pendens clause.

##### Note
> The remarks about `PrAd`, `Frnt` and `Resu` are too terse to be understood.
Is the object in question (the one carrying the `rela` feature), the mother or the daughter?

I prefer a more informative definition.

# Clause


code|description
---|---
`Adju`|Adjunctive clause
`Attr`|Attributive clause
`Cmpl`|Complement clause
`Coor`|Coordinated clause
`Objc`|Object clause

`PreC`|Predicative complement clause
`ReVo`|Referral to the vocative
`Resu`|Resumptive clause
`RgRc`|Regens/rectum connection
`Spec`|Specification clause
`Subj`|Subject clause

For *clause*-like objects this feature is also called *clause constituent relation*;
it indicates the syntactic function of the clause.
