**number**


The number class a word (or rather lexeme) belongs to.

This feature is present on objects of type
[`word`](otype.md).

`sg`     |singular
`du`     |dual
`pl`     |plural
`NA`     |not applicable
`unknown`|unknown

There are three genders in the Hebrew Bible, singular (`sg`) and plural (`pl`) and a much rarer dual (`du`).
Not all words have number (e.g. adverbs) and these are marked as `NA`.
There are words that do have number, but whose number class is unknown to us,
because they only occur in forms that do not mark it;
these are marked as `unknown`.
