**node mapping**

Maps all nodes of a previous version of the BHSA to the nodes of this version of the BHSA.

The `ll` bit is in fact something like `2017-2021` in which case it is the mapping
from version 2017 to 2021.

Mappings are not perfect in general, because between versions words can have split or merged,
and the same holds for phrases, clauses, sentences.

De mapping does a fair job though, and it keeps the information about how good the correspondence
is between a pair of nodes.

For all the intricacies of node mapping, consult the notebook that created the mapping:
