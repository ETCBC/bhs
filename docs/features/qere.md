title: `qere`

**qere (to be read, if different from ketiv, what is written)**

This feature is present on objects of type
[`word`](otype.md).

The unpointed representation of a *qere* word occurrence in Hebrew script when
the *ketiv* is a divergent from the qere.

When there is a ketiv-qere discrepancy, this feature contains the *vocalized*
qere, whereas the ketiv is generally unvocalised.

Where there is no such discrepancy, this feature is undefined (in Text-Fabric
it will yield `None`).

See for an example [Genesis
12:8]({{shebanq}}/hebrew/text?book=Genesis&chapter=12&verse=8&tp=txt_p)
