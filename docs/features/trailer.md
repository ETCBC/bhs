**interword material -pointed-transliterated**


The material that follows the word in question, up till the next word.

This feature is present on objects of type
[`word`](otype.md).

The value consists of spaces, newlines, punctuations and special marks
that sometimes occur between verses, such as the
*nun hafukha*, and the *samekh* and *pe* markers.

??? caution "Paseq"
    The *paseq* can interact with accents in the preceding word.
    See [Cantillation](../cantillation.md).

??? note "Spaceless word boundaries"
    Not all words in Hebrew are separated by a space.
    This feature is the only one that gives the information whether there is a
    space between words.
