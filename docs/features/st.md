**state**


Form of the noun that indicates a connection with a neighbouring noun.

This feature is present on objects of type
[`word`](otype.md).

There are three states in the Hebrew Bible:

code|description
---|---
`a` |absolute 
`c` |construct 
`e` |emphatic 

Not all words have person (e.g. adverbs) and these are marked as `NA`.

##### Note
> A better definition of the concept of state and its particular values is needed.
