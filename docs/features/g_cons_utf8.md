**word -consonantal-Hebrew**


The consonantal representation of a word occurrence in Hebrew script.

This feature is present on objects of type
[`word`](otype.md).

Only the consonants of the word occurrence are present: no vowel pointing and no other diacritical marks.

##### Hint
> It is difficult to enter Hebrew text. One of the handiest ways to get Hebrew text into a query is to copy and paste it
from some other Hebrew text, e.g. from the [SHEBANQ]({{shebanq}}).

You could try to copy and paste Hebrew text into a word processor, then remove all diacritics, and paste the result into
your query as a value for [`g_cons`](g_cons.md).
