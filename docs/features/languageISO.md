**language (ISO)**


The language a word (or rather lexeme) belongs to.

This feature is present on objects of type
[`word` and `lex`](otype.md).
(Only in version 2021 it is present on *lex* nodes as well).

There are only two languages in the Hebrew Bible.
Aramaic is, like Hebrew, a semitic language.
The ISO-639 codes and descriptions of these languages are:

ISO-639-code ISO-639 description | name
---|---
`hbo` |    Ancient Hebrew
`arc` |    Official Aramaic; Imperial Aramaic
