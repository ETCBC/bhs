`unknown`|unknown

There are three person classes in the Hebrew Bible, first (`p1`) and second (`p2`) and third person (`p3`).
Not all words have person (e.g. adverbs) and these are marked as `NA`.
There are words that do have person, but whose person class is unknown to us,
because they only occur in forms that do not mark it;
these are marked as `unknown`.
