**vocalized lexeme -pointed-hebrew**

The pointed representation of the lexeme of a word occurrence in Hebrew script.

This feature is present on objects of type
[`word` and `lex`](otype.md).

Only the consonants and vowels of the word lexeme are present: no other diacritical marks.

The values of *vocalized lexeme* look like the values of the [`g_lex_utf8`](g_lex_utf8.md) feature
of word occurrences, but they are not the same.
The *vocalized lexeme* is an idealized (aka *paradigmatic*), pointed representation of the lexeme,
which may or may not occur in the text.
The [`g_lex_utf8`](g_lex_utf8.md) is the realized lexeme in a concrete occurrence, of which it may be a part.
