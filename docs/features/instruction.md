**to change the set of actors**

The so called instruction of a clause atom.

This feature is present on objects of type [*clause_atom*](otype.md).

The value is something like ``.q``, ``..``, ``.d``, ``ve``.

A paragraph or subparagraph is started with the changing of the actual set of
actors, through the introduction of an explicit NP-subject, typically
by a WayX or WXQt clause.

The instruction can:
* Add an actor to the (empty) set
* Reverse the roles in the set of actors: parallel connection
* Suspend other actors in the set

##### Caution

> More clarification needed as to what the values mean.
